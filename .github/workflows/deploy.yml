name: CI/CD Pipeline

# EXPLANATION: This tells GitHub Actions when to run this workflow
# - "push" to "main" branch means every time you push code to main
# - "pull_request" means when someone creates a PR targeting main
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    tags: [ 'v*' ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# EXPLANATION: Environment variables available to ALL jobs in this workflow
# Using GHCR (GitHub Container Registry) which is ghcr.io
env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  # This creates an image name like: ghcr.io/yourusername/fastapi-llm-inference
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}

jobs:
  # JOB 1: Run Tests
  # EXPLANATION: This job checks that our code works before building/deploying
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      # EXPLANATION: Checkout = download your code from GitHub to the runner
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # EXPLANATION: Install Python so we can run our tests
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      
      # EXPLANATION: Install our app's dependencies from requirements.txt
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r app/requirements.txt
      
      # EXPLANATION: Run pytest - if ANY test fails, the workflow stops here
      # This prevents broken code from being deployed
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest app/tests/ -v

  # JOB 2: Build and Push Docker Image
  # EXPLANATION: "needs: test" means this only runs if tests pass
  build-and-push:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # EXPLANATION: These permissions allow the workflow to push to GHCR
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # EXPLANATION: Log in to GitHub Container Registry using your GitHub token
      # secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically provided by GitHub - no setup needed!

          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      
      # EXPLANATION: Extract metadata for Docker tags
      # This creates tags like: ghcr.io/user/repo:main and ghcr.io/user/repo:sha-abc123
      - name: Extract metadata
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@v5

            type=ref,event=branch
            type=ref,event=tag
            type=sha
      
      # EXPLANATION: Build the Docker image and push it to GHCR
      # "context: ./app" means use the Dockerfile in the app/ directory
      # "tags" from metadata step above
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:

  # JOB 3: Deploy to Render
  # EXPLANATION: This triggers Render to pull the new Docker image and redeploy
  # "needs: build-and-push" means this only runs after image is successfully pushed
  deploy:
    needs: build-and-push
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      # EXPLANATION: Render provides a "Deploy Hook" URL
      # When we make an HTTP request to this URL, Render automatically:
      # 1. Pulls the latest image from GHCR
      # 2. Stops the old container
      # 3. Starts a new container with the new image
      - name: Trigger Render deployment
        run: |
          curl -X POST ${{ secrets.RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK }}
